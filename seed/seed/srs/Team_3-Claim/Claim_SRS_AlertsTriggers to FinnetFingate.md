# 1. Introduction

The **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Triggers & Alerts with**
**FINnet/FINGate Integration Module** is part of IMS 2.0, designed to
improve compliance in the insurance sector, which faces risks of money
laundering and terrorist financing. The module supports requirements
from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)
and the Financial Intelligence Unit--India (FIU-IND) by automating
detection, risk scoring, alert generation, and regulatory reporting for
suspicious transactions.This document outlines software and functional
specifications for integrating the AML module with **FINnet/FINGate**,
ensuring STRs, CTRs, CCRs, and NTRs are securely filed within statutory
deadlines. It also maintains a complete audit trail for inspections and
audits.

Built to be scalable and adaptable, the module aligns with evolving AML
regulations and can be updated as needed. Related topics include **PAN
API integration**, **CRM workflows**, and **Archival Policy**.

**2. Applicable Regulatory Guidelines**

**2.1 Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and Rules**

- **PMLA, 2002** is the core statute requiring "[Reporting
  Entities]{.mark}" (banks, FIs, insurers, etc.) to submit STRs, CTRs,
  Counterfeit Currency Reports (CCR), Non-Profit Organisation
  Transaction Reports (NTR), and others to the FIU-IND.

- [Under **Section 12**]{.mark} and associated rules, reporting entities
  must furnish information on prescribed transactions (single or
  connected) within scheduled timelines.

**2.2** **FIU-India STR/CTR XML Schema & Submission Guide**

- Specifies XML and, in recent updates, (for some bulk uploads) JSON
  payloads, as the submission format for STR, CTR, CCR, CBWTR, NTR, and
  PTR.

- Essential documents: "**Reporting Format Guide**" (v2.2),
  "**AccountBasedReport.xsd**", "**TransactionBasedReport.xsd**".

**2.3 IRDAI AML Guidelines**

- IRDAI Master AML Guidelines and the **IRDAI Insurance Fraud Monitoring
  Framework Guidelines, 2025** lay out AML/CFT duties of insurers,
  including reporting via FINnet/FINGate, thresholds, foul-play
  indicators, and compliance controls specific to the insurance sector.

**2.4 PML (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005 (as amended up to 2023)**

- Mandate CDD, record keeping for minimum five years, and specify
  reportable transaction types and deadlines for submission.

**3. Integration Scope and Filing Conditions**

This integration SRS concerns the automated and/or semi-automated
transfer of AML alerts (STR/CTR triggers) generated by in-house or
third-party AML monitoring engines into FINnet/FINGate-compliant
filings. The scope encompasses all logic, data mapping, transformation,
workflow automation, and interface mechanisms between the *source* (AML
Alert/Case Management System) and the *target* (FINnet/FINGate Filing
System).

**3.1** **Inclusion Criteria**

- **Alerts** that meet the internal STR/CTR/CBWTR/NTR/CCR trigger logic
  and require regulatory submission within statutory deadlines.

- **Batch Submissions:** Only filings of the same report type per batch
  (e.g., batch = STR only; CTR only, etc.).

- **Mandatory Inclusion of all Statutorily Required Fields** as per
  FIU's XML schema.

**3.2 Exclusion Criteria**

- Cases flagged as "false positive" not escalated for reporting.

- Internal alerts with incomplete or unverifiable KYC/transactional
  information to be excluded until rectified.

- Manual/statistical disclosures (outside normal workflow) not subject
  to this integration.

**3.3** **Filing Conditions**

- **STR Filings:** Upon determination of suspicion (as per predefined
  rules and compliance escalation), to be filed within [7 working
  days]{.mark}.

- **CTR Filings:** Transaction aggregates exceeding specified thresholds
  (e.g., ₹10 lakh [in cash in one day]{.mark}), to be reported monthly.

- **Other Reports (CBWTR, CCR, NTR, PTR):** As dictated by respective
  guidelines and sectors.

- **No mixing of STR and CTR in the same batch**; segregated, uniquely
  identified batch files per type.

**3.4 Interfacing Protocols**

- Data exchange to occur over API or file transfer (SFTP, portal
  upload), as supported by FINGate, in XML or, for some bulk scenarios,
  JSON formats compliant with the latest FIU-IND schemas.

**4. Data Mapping between AML Alerts and FINnet Schema**

**A comprehensive mapping table** is also required to ensure every data
element outputted by the AML alerts engine is translated into the
expected fields of FINnet's XML/JSON schema. This requires development
of IMS 2.0 and thereafter detail mapping in sync with FINnet schema can
be given.

**5. Filing Workflow, System Actions, and Interface Logic**

This section details the sequence, actions, and logic governing the
filing of STR/CTR and related reports, from alert detection to FINnet
acknowledgment.

**5.1 Workflow Overview**

> **[[Step-by-Step Process]{.underline}]{.mark}**

- **Alert is Triggered** : AML system detects a suspicious transaction
  or cash threshold breach.

- **Alert is Reviewed** Compliance team investigates. If it needs to be
  reported, it's:marked "To Be Reported".

- **Report is Prepared** System collects all required data and converts
  it into XML or JSON format as per FIU's rules.

- **Validation Check** System checks for missing fields or errors using
  FIU's latest schema.

- **Batch is Created** All STRs or CTRs for the day are grouped into one
  batch per type (no mixing). Each batch gets a unique ID.

- **Digital Signature Added** The batch file is digitally signed using a
  secure method (like pfx or e-token).

- **Submission to FIU-India** The signed file is sent either:

  - Automatically via API.

  - Manually via the FINGate portal.

- **Acknowledgment Received** FIU sends back a status: Accepted,
  Rejected, or Error. This is updated in the AML system.

6\. **SRS Sections Dependent on IMS 2.0 Development**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **SRS points**       **Dependency on    **Justification**
                       IMS 2.0**          
  -------------------- ------------------ -------------------------------
  **Data Mapping       Field names,       Mapping requires finalized AML
  Table**              formats, and alert alert schema from IMS 2.0 to
                       structures         align with FINnet XML/JSON

  **Filing Trigger     Alert              STR/CTR/NTR triggers depend on
  Logic**              classification and how IMS 2.0 defines rule
                       escalation logic   thresholds and case statuses

  **Field Validation   Field-level        Validation logic (e.g.,
  Rules**              definitions and    mandatory PAN, date format)
                       constraints        depends on IMS 2.0 field design

  **Error Handling     Alert lifecycle    Error types (e.g., missing PAN,
  Matrix**             and exception      invalid amount) depend on how
                       handling           IMS 2.0 processes alerts

  **Interface          Internal data      API payloads and submission
  Specifications**     model and          logic require IMS 2.0's
                       integration layer  finalized field structure and
                                          endpoints

  **Annexure -- Sample Alert data and     Sample XML/JSON filings can
  Payloads**           field values       only be generated once IMS 2.0
                                          alert format is frozen

  **User Roles &       Workflow and user  Filing permissions and digital
  Access Control** (if hierarchy          signing roles depend on IMS
  applicable)                             2.0's user management logic
